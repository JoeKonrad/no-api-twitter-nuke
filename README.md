Removes all tweets (posts) in Twitter (X) through the browser  
~~This will be my attempt at using the requests library rather than Selenium~~  
It looks unlikely that the requests library will be able to accomplish this task, still researching.  
I'll probably have to use Selenium, which is fine, it just wasn't the ideal outcome.  
Twitter is stupid, the API is locked behind a wall. So I'll have to come up with another project where I can use requests, but this will be a headless Selenium task, most likely.  
Also, nice to have will be to save the content to a text file for the user
